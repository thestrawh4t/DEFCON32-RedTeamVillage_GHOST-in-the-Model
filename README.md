PowerPoint presentation delivered at Red Team Village for DEFCON 32.

## GHOST in the Model:
### Generating AI-Assisted Threat Models for Efficient Offensive Security Testing
Step into a cybernetic world where humanity and technology intertwine in a complex dance of evolution. Just like the cyberpunk masterpiece, we will augment our cybersecurity defenses through the fusion of artificial intelligence and human ingenuity.

In this presentation, we explore the symbiotic relationship between humans and AI, mirroring the fusion of man and machine in Ghost in the Shell. Through the lens of AI-enhanced threat modeling, we uncover how Generative Artificial Intelligence Language Models (GenAI LLMs) empower penetration testing and red teaming professionals to transcend traditional boundaries and improve security early in the design process. Additionally, they contribute to more efficient testing of completed systems and applications.

Join us as we journey through the cybernetic landscape, where attendees will learn to merge human intuition with AI intelligence to fortify solutions and improve offensive security testing. Together, we will transcend the limitations of conventional approaches and embrace the cybernetic evolution that awaits us.
